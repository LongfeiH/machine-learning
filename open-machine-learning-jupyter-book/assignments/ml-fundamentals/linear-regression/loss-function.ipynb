    "\n",
    "- A loss function gauges the disparity between the model's predictions and the actual values. Simply put, it indicates how \"off\" our model is. By optimizing this function, our objective is to identify parameters that bring the model's predictions as close as possible to the true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function we want to minimize or maximize is called the objective function or criterion. When we are minimizing it, we may also call it the cost function, loss function, or error function.\n",

    "- Huber Loss: A hybrid loss that's quadratic for small differences and linear for large ones, providing resilience against outliers.\n",

    "## Empirical Risk and Structural Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you've heard of these two concepts before. In the realms of machine learning and statistics, the concepts of empirical risk and structural risk are intricately tied to loss functions. **However, these terms aren't directly categories of loss functions perse.** Let's first clarify these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Empirical Risk:** Refers to the average loss of a model over a given dataset. Minimizing empirical risk focuses on reducing errors explicitly on the training data.\n",
    "2. **Structural Risk:** Introduces a regularization term in addition to empirical risk, aiming to prevent overfitting. Minimizing structural risk strikes a balance between the empirical risk and the complexity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Empirical Risk:** Loss functions directly related to dataset performance fall under this category. From the ones been listed, regression losses (e.g., MSE, MAE, Huber Loss, L1 Loss, L2 Loss, Smooth L1 Loss), classification losses (e.g., Cross Entropy Loss, Hinge Loss, Log Loss), and structured losses (e.g., CTC or Image Segmentation Loss) can be seen as manifestations of empirical risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structural Risk:** Regularization losses, like L1 and L2 regularization, form part of structural risk. They don't measure the model's performance on the data directly but rather serve to rein in model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Detaphor\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe it's still abtract. So, now imagine you're a tailor trying to make a dress for a client.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Empirical Risk:** This is like ensuring the dress fits the client perfectly based on a single fitting session. You measure every contour and make the dress to match those exact measurements. The dress is a perfect fit for the client on that particular day.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if the client gains or loses a little weight or wants to move more comfortably? A dress tailored too tightly to the exact measurements might not be very adaptable or comfortable in various situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structural Risk:** Now, consider that you decide to allow a bit more flexibility in the dress. You make it slightly adjustable, perhaps with some elastic portions. This way, even if the client's measurements change a bit, the dress will still fit comfortably. You're sacrificing a tiny bit of the \"perfect\" fit for the adaptability and general comfort.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Relying solely on **Empirical Risk** would be like fitting the dress exactly to the client's measurements, risking overfitting. If the data changes slightly, the model might perform poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factoring in **Structural Risk** ensures the model isn't overly tailored to the training data and can generalize well to new, unseen data. It's about ensuring a balance between a perfect fit and adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have a general understanding of the meaning of empirical risk and structural risk. Let's delve into a more mathematical perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ comprising input-output pairs $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, ... $(x_n, y_n)$ and a model $f$ parameterized by $\\theta$, the empirical risk and structural risk can be formally defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Empirical Risk(Cost Function):**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R_{emp}(f) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} L(y_i, f(x_i; \\theta))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$L$ is the loss function**, measuring the discrepancy between the predicted value $f(x_i; \\theta)$ and the actual output $y_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical risk quantifies how well the model fits the given dataset, representing the average loss of the model on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structural Risk(Objective Function):**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R_{struc}(f) = R_{emp}(f) + \\lambda R_{reg}(\\theta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $R_{reg}(\\theta)$ is the regularization term, penalizing the complexity of the model.\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ is a regularization coefficient determining the weight of the regularization term relative to the empirical risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural risk is a combination of the empirical risk and a penalty for model complexity. It strikes a balance between fitting the training data (empirical risk) and ensuring the model isn't overly complex (which can lead to overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences and Relations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Empirical Risk** focuses solely on minimizing the error on the training data without considering model complexity or how it generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "2. **Structural Risk** takes into account both the empirical risk and the complexity of the model. By introducing a regularization term, it ensures that the model doesn't become overly complex and overfit the training data. Thus, it balances performance on training data with generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, while empirical risk aims for performance on the current dataset, structural risk aims for good performance on new data by penalizing overly complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Function and Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical risk and cost functions are in many cases the same and represent the average loss on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural risk is often viewed as an objective function, especially when regularization is considered. But the term \"objective function\" is broader and is not limited to structural risk but can also include other optimization objectives."

# Guidelines for contributing to the open Machine Learning book

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this open-source Machine Learning book! We greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before you submit any pull requests or issues. It will help us work together more effectively.

## How to contribute

To contribute, send us a pull request. Please review our general [Guidelines for contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Style guide](../STYLE_GUIDE.md) before you start.

## Notes for contributors

This section describes the development environment setup and workflow which should be followed when modifying/porting Python code and making changes to one of the machine learning frameworks in the book. We follow a set of pre-defined [Style guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md) for consistent code quality throughout the book and expect the same from our community contributors. You may need to check other chapters from other contributors as well for this step.

All the chapter sections are generated by [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/index.html).

### Install Python & Conda

Before you start, you will need [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) and [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your computer.

Add the following paths(depending on your OS) to the environment variable `PATH`` if needed. To Windows,

```bash
D:\Python\Python310\Scripts\
D:\Python\Python310\
D:\anaconda3\Scripts
```

### Install Jupyter Book

Follow the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/overview.html) official guidance to install the latest version.

### Install draw.io

[draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) is needed for generating draw.io-based diagrams in build time. Install the [draw.io desktop application](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases) on your local machine. By default, the draw.io execution is correctly located at the platform-appropriate path:

* Windows: `C:\Program Files\draw.io\draw.io.exe` (Attention: Don't change the installation path.)
* Linux: `/opt/drawio/drawio` or `/opt/draw.io/drawio` (older versions)
* macOS: `/Applications/draw.io.app/Contents/MacOS/draw.io`.

Mostly, you don't need to do anything here. The executable will be picked up by [sphinxcontrib-drawio](https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-drawio/) automatically.

### Initialize the environment

Clone the source code from remote through your preferred protocol.

```bash
# through HTTP
git clone https://github.com/ocademy-ai/machine-learning.git
```

Move to the working directory.

```bash
cd machine-learning/open-machine-learning-jupyter-book/
```

Initialize the Conda env.

```bash
# first time setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
# or update
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

### Activate the Conda environment

```bash
conda activate open-machine-learning-jupyter-book
```

### Build the book

```bash
# official guidance - https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/build.html

# Windows
jupyter-book build .

# Mac
# if you are using bash
bash ./build.sh
# or you can rebuild everything
bash ./build-force-all.sh
```

Then you should be able to follow the build success message to view the book locally.

To Mac,

> **Warning**
>
> You may encounter following problem when you program on ARM-based M1 Mac.
>
> ```bash
> OSError: no library called "cairo-2" was found
> no library called "cairo" was found
> no library called "libcairo-2" was found
> ```
>
> Solution:
>
> 1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
> 2. Fetch Homebrew sources:
>
> ```bash
> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
> ```
>
> 3. Install the below missing dependencies through Homebrew:
>
> ```bash
> brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libxml2 libxslt libffi
> ```
>
> 4. Find out the path of `cairo`, `glib` and `pango` installation, and export them to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:
>
> ```bash
> # for example
> export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/cairo/1.16.0_5/lib/:/opt/homebrew/Cellar/pango/1.50.9/lib/:/opt/homebrew/Cellar/glib/2.72.3_1/lib/
> ```
>
> **How to find out above pathes?** Here is an example of cairo:
>
> * Run the command `which brew`.
> * If the response is `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew`, now we get the Homebrew root path as '/opt/homebrew/'.(**The result may depend on your OS!!**)
> * Check if `cairo`, `glib`, `pango` are existing in `/opt/homebrew/Cellar`.
> * Find out the lib path for above libraries, such as `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/cairo/1.16.0_5/lib`.(**The result may depend on your OS!! Remind again.**)
>
> 5. Rerun `jupyter-book build .`
> 6. Run `pip uninstall xcffib` if error still exists, and then try again.

To Windows,

>
> Restart the terminal and build again.

### Build the slides (optional)

The slides are implemented as notebooks in `slides/`, which is powered by [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE).

If you want to edit or preview the slides locally, you need to use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Once you use Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab to load the project, the slide will be launched in live mode after you open any corresponding notebook.

```bash
# Install javascript and css files
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user

# Enabling extensions
jupyter nbextension enable init_cell/main

# Launch the notebook
jupyter notebook
```

> **Warning**
>
> Please make sure the Jupyter Notebook is running in trusted mode, and the [init_cell](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/init_cell/README.html) is configured for the first cell of slide notebook. So that the first cell will be automatically executed to load the CSS.

## FAQ

**Regarding the deletion and addition of the _toc.yml file:**

```bash
 *  The _toc file is located in the open-machine-learning-jupyter-book [directory](https://github.com/ocademy-ai/machine-learning/blob/main/open-machine-learning-jupyter-book/_toc.yml)
 *  In Jupyter Book, the _toc.yml file is the file used to define the directory structure of the book, containing the book chapters, sub-chapters and page hierarchy.
 *  When you build your book using Jupyter Book, it reads the _toc.yml file and generates a navigation bar based on the directory structure in it.
 *  To speed up the local book build, you can keep only the content of the chapters you changed for the build. This speeds up the build and ignores errors reported by other chapters.
 *  However, when deleting other chapters, pay attention to ensure the integrity of the entire book structure, otherwise it may lead to error reporting, it is recommended that when you first get started, one by one CAPTION deletion.
 *  After the preview, please restore the original _toc structure
```

**Non-consecutive header level increase**

You may see below failures when building the books:

```bash
 WARNING: Non-consecutive header level increase; 0 to 2 [myst.header]
```

This error is caused by the presence of a non-consecutive heading level increase in the specified Jupyter notebook file. Specifically, the heading level increases directly from 0 to 2 without going through level 1.
To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:
```bash
1. Open the specified Jupyter notebook file.
2. Check the setting for the heading level, which in this lesson is the number of '#'.
3. Ensure that the heading level increases continuously without skipping any levels.
4. If you find a non-continuous heading level increase, adjust it to a continuous level increase.
5. Save the file and re-run the code to ensure the error has been resolved.
6. Take care of '---', this will be recognize as a title. If you are transforming md file to ipynb file, and confirm that the above situation does not exist, please delete the last '---'.
```

**Can't run the code locally**

You may encounter a situation where the code cannot be run locally. You can try uploading the document to [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) for running, and then download the file containing the results to submit a PR locally.

**Couldn't find cache key**

You may meet a error like this:
```
ERROR: Execution Failed: /home/runner/work/machine-learning/machine-learning/open-machine-learning-jupyter-book/data-science/data-visualization/visualization-distributions.md
ERROR: Couldn't find cache key for notebook file data-science/data-visualization/visualization-distributions.md. Outputs will not be inserted.
```

To solve this error, you can find the file and just add a ' ' in anywhere of the file, just to resubmit it. And then delete the ' ' in next commit to make sure the file not exist in you PR.
